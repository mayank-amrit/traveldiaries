            <h2>Mussoorie - The Queen of Hills</h2>
            <h3>Mall Road, Mussoorie</h3>
            <p>The queen has chilled us to bones. Mussoorie, the cold beauty, had us experience mixed emotions. We smiled, we cried, we laughed and we shivered. But we enjoyed and had the best of times. Mall Road is considered as the center of attraction in Mussoorie and it was, indeed. The place welcomed us with a bone chilling breeze directly from the heavens.</p>

            <p>Mussoorie is a place of the infamous pahari culture. The people you meet are very respectful, welcoming and generous. Alongside the Maggies and Chais, the breathtaking views of the hills and the warm gestures of the people were the highlights.</p>

            <h3>George Everest Peak</h3>
            <p>We embarked upon the most tiring expedition i.e the trek to the top of George Everest Peak. Our lungs were gassing out and our legs were pulling us down. At a point, I was lost and didn't want to continue the 7km trek but after reaching the top, no regrets!!!!!</p>

            <h2>Rishikesh - The city of sages</h2>
            <h3>Triveni Sangam</h3>
            <p>After experiencing the cold, it was time for some relaxation. After reaching Rishikesh, we realised that we set foot on the most spiritual yet a happening place. The strolls along Ganga, the tiny cafes with beautiful ambience, the cool breeze from the rivers and the strong culture of Hinduism has taken us to a vibrant joy.</p>

            <h2>Haridwar - Gateway to Gods</h2>
            <p>It was time for us to explore yet another masterpiece city - Haridwar. Known as the Gateway to Gods, the place has the vibe of a medieval era town with interesting people and a aura of divinity. At Haridwar, from the methods of worship and spiritual attainment to roadside sweets and shopping avenues, a lot of diversity is offered. </p>
